##Insight Webaplication written in AngularJS

This branch contains the code of the actual web application written in AngularJS, that will query the Json API and display the results in a nice an fancy way to the overjoyed user.

You can (and should !) see it in action on [flockingComments.com](http://flockingComments.com) !

As the application is quite limite only one model has been created in js/mypp.js and only a few different controllers in js/thecontrollers.js
